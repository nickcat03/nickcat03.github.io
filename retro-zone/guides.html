            <h3>Guides</h3>
            <p>These are guides that I have written up myself. I will organize these guides into categories once I write more.
                For the time being, they are sorted chronologically based on date written.
            </p>
            <p>Note that some guides may require prior knowledge to a given subject, but what is needed to be known will be stated 
                in the guide itself. I want to make sure my guides are as "noob-friendly" as possible.
