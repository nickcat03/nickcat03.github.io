            <h2>How to Retro</h2>
            <p>Retro collecting can look intimidating. Like, <i>really</i> intimidating (at least for me when I started out). On the surface, 
            it requires a lot of room to store everything, all the cables to get the best video output, and a deep pocket of money. But in reality, 
            retro collecting doesn't need to be like that at all when you are first starting out.</p>
            <p>
                This guide is going to be going in-depth on many, <i>many</i>, things, which is ironic because I said it isn't intimidating realistically. This guide is 
                long because it is meant to inform you of the options that are available, as if you were starting out with no knowledge of the subject.
                When I first started in the retro scene, there were many things that I wish I knew about in more detail when starting out. I also want to
                make people aware of how far this hobby could be taken, as a lot of other hobbies can stem from retro collecting. I hope that the amount of information 
                does not discourage you from delving deeper into it.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing to note is that this is meant for those who want to collect the original hardware. If you are a fan of retro games, but don't want to deal with 
                the aging hardware, you are awesome and should keep loving what you love. If you want to play on the original stuff, keep reading.
            </p>
            <h3 id="chp1">Buying the Stuff</h3>
            <p>
                I started collecting about 4 years ago, and I grew quite a sizable collection. However, my collection started with a single console, 
                and that was my N64. It was one of the first consoles I ever wanted because of the weird controller (literally that's the only reason why, I just wanted to play with the weird controller).
                Which relates to my first point...
            </p>
            <h4>Start Small</h4>
            <p>
                This is very important. Before even buying anything, think about the one console you want the most. What's the one thing you desperately 
                want to buy <i>right now</i> (you know the feeling). What brings you the most excitement? It could be from nostalgia, or because you want to 
                own a relic of the past. Just make sure you are buying a single console.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm saying this because it's best to buy a little at a time. Just <i>enjoy</i> it and don't rush into everything. Especially around this time where 
                retro video games are really going up there in price, which leads me to...
            </p>
            <h4>Watch Prices</h4>
            <p>
                The golden standard for price watching retro material is <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/">PriceCharting.com</a>, but I wouldn't make this the de-facto 
                price range for items. PriceCharting has some inaccuracies, so it's best to just check the prices yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that it could sometimes be tempting to buy things when you see them for lower than market, especially out of fear that the market goes up even <i>higher</i>
                (and trust me, it's happened to me before). I would say the best way to go is to go with your gut. Do you see the item as being worth the money it is being shown for?
                If yes, then buy it. Buy whatever makes you happy, but just be smart about your purchasing decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few purchases I have made that I whole-heartedly regret, and there are ones that paid off tremendously over time. You will have many of those too. 
            </p>
            <h4>Spotting Fakes</h4>
            <p>
                Be careful of fakes! Whether it be a game or a console, fakes can pop up everywhere, especially for games in the higher price range. The best way to check for 
                Nintendo cartridge games is to find a number/letter indentation on the cartridge, whether it be on the back or front. There are other tell-tale signs such as 
                the Nintendo logo being off, or the cartridge label having a very glossy finish. It is also recommended to make sure you check the seller and customer reviews.
                Always compare listings with each other.
            </p>
            <h4>Where to Buy?</h4>
            <p>
                There are many platforms that you can buy from! Here are a few:
            </p>
            <h5>eBay</h5>
            <img style="float:right; margin:10px;" src="../../images/ebay-sort.png">
            <p>
                Ebay is pretty much the go-to place for retro stuff, which is a good and a bad thing. You can find a plethora of items there, but most of the time everything 
                will be market price, if not more. Additionally, there is a good amount of competition when bidding for items. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the best way to sort for items on eBay is to try "Lowest Price". You can find this option on the right side. The default sort is "Best Match".
                On mobile, it is in the side menu in the top right. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to bidding, you may be tempted to start bidding as soon as you see an item. In reality, bidding on items in the early stages does nothing but
                boost the cost of the item. I personally do not bid <i>at all</i> until the very end of the bidding period, near the last 10 seconds or so. This is typically called "sniping".
                If you don't snipe, you will lose bids, and that's the reality we live in when it comes to eBay. Everyone else tends to snipe, so the only way to win is to fight
                fire with fire.
            </p>
            <h5>Mercari</h5>
            <p>Mercari is honestly a great platform if prices aren't looking too hot on eBay. Rather than competing with people on bids, Mercari's gimmick is that you place offers
                on an item to lower the price that the seller has put it up for (I <i>guess</i> you can consider it reverse bidding). 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can place an offer, but the risk is that someone can place an offer that's higher price than yours, so the seller won't choose your offer.
                However, you can also just buy the item for the price it's listed.
                Typically, if an item has a lot of competition, I just buy it for the price it is listed as. Most of the time, the risk you are taking for
                offering a lower price is not worth the $10 you're attempting to save, especially if it's an item that is highly contested for. 
            </p>
            <h5>Facebook Marketplace</h5>
            <p>FB Market isn't the best, notably with retro stuff. The hard part is trying to find listings of retro stuff being sold on the platform. I think it is a great 
                last option to try to save a bit of money if possible, but ultimately I do not use it much at all.
            </p>
            <h5>Retro Game Stores</h5>
            <p>
                Mmmmmmm, going outside. It's definitely a committment, but determination can give you motivation to go to an in-person store. I am personally not against them,
                but it's going to depend on the store you're going to. In-person has many pros, such as seeing the game yourself and, if the store has the rep, a guarantee that 
                the games are authentic. A con to this though is that these stores can get <i>expensive</i>. I would recommend checking on a store's site or calling them to check 
                their price ranges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on my experiences, I have been to a lot of stores that I do not like. Most of them will make the claim that they 
                clean the consoles/carts for you, or resurface the disks you buy, but then sell it $100 above market price (looking at you DKOldies). 
                Cleaning your own consoles is very easy, and I will go over how to do so later on in this guide.
                Disk resurfacing isn't the easiest or safest to DIY, but there are shops that will resurface for as little as $5.</p>
            <p>
                On the upside, one store that I really liked is <a target="_blank" href="https://bonds25000.wixsite.com/websitevgtp">Video Game Trading Post</a>.
                If you're in or near New York, you should definitely check them out. They have a few stores in Long Island.
            </p>
            <h3 id="chp2">Getting it on the TV</h3>
            <p>Yay!! Your console shipped to you and now it's sitting on your table, and you have no idea how to hook it up to a modern television...</p>
            <p>
                Yeah, unfortunately it isn't as easy as just grabbing an HDMI cable and plugging it in the TV. Majority, if not all consoles that were produced in the 90's to early 
                2000's will have either RF, composite, s-video, or RGB output, which are all analog connections. HDMI is a digital connection, for example.
                The specifications behind analog and digital aren't important for our purpose, but it's good to know if brought up somewhere.
                Lets go over those video options!
            </p>
            <h4>RF</h4>
            <p>RF is basically the worst video signal you can have, as video and audio is being ran through a single cable. I'm pretty sure every flat-panel TV nowadays won't have an RF jack on them.
                RF is only a requirement for consoles such as the Famicom (Japanese NES), which <i>only</i> have RF output. Unless you want that authentic shitty quality experience from the late 80's there's 
                no reason to have this cable.
            </p>
            <h4>Composite</h4>
            <p>
                If you have a flat panel, these are the ports that may be on the back of your TV. These are the yellow, red, and white cables. Composite is an upgrade from RF, but 
                still not the best. Audio is now ran from two separate cables, but running all the video data on a single analog cable still doesn't allow for the best quality.
            </p>
            <h4>S-Video</h4>
            <p>
                S-video is a large upgrade from composite in terms of video quality. S-video is hard to find on flat-panels, but are easier to find on consumer CRTs. The video is split 
                as "Chroma" and "Luma" signals. Think of it as splitting the video signal across two separate composite cables into one wire.
            </p>
            <h4>RGB</h4>
            <p>
                And here's where it gets confusing. RGB is a broad term, but it is essentially the highest quality of video you can get out of analog.
                RGB, as its name suggests, splits the video signal into red, green, and blue, so that video is running across three analog signals (rather than composite's one, for comparison).
                To not get confused, RGB is <i>not</i> the name of a single connector, but rather a category of connectors that are capable of this type of output.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retrorgb.com/rgbintro.html">RetroRGB</a> sums it up pretty well on their website, but I'll give the tl;dr of it all.
            </p>
            <h5>SCART</h5>
            <p>
                If you live in America, you're probably asking yourself, "what the hell is SCART?", and if you're in Europe you're probably looking at that American like "how 
                the hell have you not heard of SCART before?". SCART has been a standard in Europe for quite a while now, while it was never here in America. The only way to
                really utilize SCART, at least outside of Europe, is to use upscalers that convert the signal into HDMI.
            </p>
            <h5>Component</h5>
            <p>
                These are the three red, green and blue wires that were standard here in America, though the colors on these wires are a bit of a misconception. Component is 
                not necessarily RGB, but rather a signal called YPbPr. This isn't really important because Component and SCART are essentially the same quality, but I know some 
                annoying person will comment on that.
            </p>
            <h5>VGA</h5>
            <p>
                I didn't forget about my computer bois and the Dreamcast fans. You will typically find VGA on older computers, and finding converters to HDMI
                are fairly easy to come across. Additionally, some modern computer monitors actually have VGA input (at least mine does).
            </p>
            <h4>"OK that's great, what the hell do I choose?"</h4>
            <p>
                ...you're probably screaming right now as I confuse you with all these video options.
            </p>
            <p>
                But have no fear, because my answer is this: Take the cheapest option...
            </p>
            <p>
                ...which is probably going to be composite. You can find some cheap converter boxes on Amazon or your preferred online shopping site if you lack the ports on your TV.
                Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Are there better options? Most definitely. Are they pretty expensive? <i>Most definitely</i>. Using upscalers is better than
                using the ports on your TV because they are developed and made for retro gaming. They won't have the latency and weird artifacting that your flat-panel may produce.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want upscalers, RetroRGB covers them all. I would recommend upscalers from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.retrotink.com/">RetroTINK</a> once you're in the 
                late game and committed to getting your video in higher quality. Keep in mind that not every console outputs RGB. I would consult RetroRGB if you'd like to find info
                on your specific console.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, do you need to have all this fancy schmancy video? <i><b>NO</b></i>. I am just introducing these options to you, in case you are interested.
                I had no intention of ever delving into this stuff four years ago, as I was enjoying myself using the composite inputs on my flat-panel. It is definitely a money sink, 
                I have spent way too much money just on getting my video in tip-top condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now that we can actually see what we are playing, lets get some games :DDDD
            </p>
            <h3>Get Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                We didn't do all this prep work for nothing, now we actually have to get games on this thing!
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, I'm sure you're a master at buying stuff online ever since you bought the console, right? <i>Right?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some games are fairly cheap. Star Fox and F-Zero are real cheap and go as high as $20. Most of the Mario games on NES also live in that price range.
                Typically launch titles that everyone's heard about are gonna be cheap. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But depending on your console, games could get quite expensive, especially the sought after ones. If you're going for Nintendo handhelds, the Pokemon games are notoriously expensive for no 
                reason. Earthbound and Super Metroid are also ones that are steep. There are some shortcuts you can take though!
            </p>
            <h4>Buy a Repro</h4>
            <p>
                But didn't I say before that we <i>don't</i> want fakes? Well, it honestly depends on the person. Does the authenticity of the game matter to you? If not, repros 
                could function the same as your standard one. There's no guarantees though. I never bothered with repros (except for my one or two accidental purchases). Repros 
                more often than not do not have good save batteries (we'll get to save batteries in a moment), and so your data could be wiped. Just be careful with them, they're 
                cheap for a reason.
            </p>
            <h4>Emulate??</h4>
            <p>
                Not the best answer, but emualating the game first can give you a feel of what the game is like before purchasing it. Though, we <i>did</i> just buy all this 
                hardware, so we'd want to play the game on there eventually. One good option to get an "authentic" experience is, if you own a CRT, using the Wii Virtual Console
                (at least for Nintendo games). 
                Hooking up a Wii to a CRT and playing certain consoles on Wii VC doesn't feel all that different to the real thing.
            </p>
            <h4>Flashcarts</h4>
            <p>
                And this is where the money pit truly begins for some consoles. Flashcarts are the de-facto all-in-one cartridge, and have the best functionality of being able to 
                play games that are ridiculously expensive on original hardware. The issue is that flashcarts are <i>also</i> ridiculously expensive. While some can be in 
                the $80 range, others can go up as high as $250. It's a hard game to play, if whether or not it's worth owning a flashcart for the money, or just to emulate on 
                other hardware. If flashcarts are a completely new term for you, they basically allow an SD card to be inserted in the cartridge with ROMs loaded on it. 
                These ROMs can then be played on original hardware. If you are interested in flashcarts, <a href="https://krikzz.com/" target="_blank">Krikzz</a> is the best option.
            </p>
            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                Considering how old the hardware is, it is good to know how to maintain these systems. Most of the time, taking apart consoles aren't all too difficult. Some may require 
                specific screwdrivers called GameBit, which are most common in Nintendo consoles and cartridges from the 90's, as well as Genesis cartridges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking apart your cartridges is a good way to confirm that they are authentic. You can easily look up the schematics of your system's cart to compare. Opening your consoles 
                and controllers will allow you to deep clean them to get all the gunk out. They are used products, after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some parts in older consoles, such as capacitors, that will eventually break as they age. Though it may be a bit longer until we should expect majority of capacitors 
                to start breaking, it should be noted that this is something that will arise in the future if you plan to keep these consoles for awhile. Capacitor replacements require soldering, 
                which is a whole other can of worms. I plan to make a guide on getting started with soldering, but it is a committment to take on. I would only worry about this once the time comes, 
                but it is something I wanted to make aware. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some capacitors that do not require replacing, and for those they could be wiggled out without soldering. An example of this is the notorious Xbox clock capacitor, 
                which has started to corrode in most systems. Taking it out
