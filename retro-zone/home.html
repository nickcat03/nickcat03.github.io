            <h3>Hey there, websurfer!</h3>
            <p>You came across a pretty big nerd over here. Welcome to my retro "shrine", the home of my love for all computers and
                video games from the 80's to the mid 2000's.
            </p>
            <h4>Loving the old, hating the new?</h4>
            <p>Well, hate is a strong word. I have a distaste for how media is treated today, whether that be microtransactions or
                half-assed yearly releases. When it comes to looking back at the past, most people perceive it with rose-tinted glasses.
                Games today costed just as much, if not more, as they did in the 90s. There was no clear-cut price range of $60, games
                varied in price. It was another form of media that was finding its place in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am someone that was born in the 2000s, so I really have no reference to how that time period was. All I have are the words
                from those who experienced it, and the media that came out during that time. I believe that one of the main contributions to my love
                for retro games is the Wii Virtual Console. When I was younger, I would buy a bunch of older games on the Wii Shop, so I grew up with
                those generations of games without necessarily being in that generation, which is awesome. Generally speaking, I enjoy games before my time.
                Most games from then are difficult and rewarding, and that's my cup of tea.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not dissing on modern games. In fact, there are several that I do enjoy, such as Splatoon and Minecraft. These modern
                games live alongside my obsession for my older favorites, like the Kirby series and SquareSoft JRPGs, to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn't old enough to experience this time period that I love. I think my obsession
                for older games comes from the fact that I want to experience that time in some form. I decided to start collecting as a
                means of trying to get as close to that experience as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently do not have my own living space, but when I do, I plan to make a "time-travel" room; a 
                room as if you were living in the 90's to early 2000's period. So far, my current collection of various items and consoles allows me 
                the ability to form such a thing. I just need... the room. Living in the city doesn't help when you are prioritizing space.
                At the current moment, this will be a dream I will strive for in the far(?) future.
            </p>
            <h4>What I Collect</h4>
            <p>
                I collect consoles and computers from the 90's, to put it simply. I don't like to pick favorites, but I will say that I mainly prioritize
                Nintendo out of my whole collection, with the PlayStation being my second favorite. I want to start getting into collecting the Sega consoles soon.
                I am not huge on Xbox, but I still own those consoles.
            <p>
                At the current rate I'm going, I keep any computer I find, as I enjoy tinkering with them, whether it be the 
                software or hardware side.
            </p>
            <h4>What's considered "retro"?</h4>
            <p>We're getting into dangerous, controversial territory here, be careful where you ask that.</p>
            <p>What I would consider retro is any console two generations behind the current generation (which would mean I consider 
            the Wii and DS to be the newest retro consoles, as well as the PS3, XB360, etc).</p>
            <p>This is solely my opinion, as retro is subjective and generally means "old", with no defined age. I just like to share 
                my interpretation of the term.
