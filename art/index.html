                <p>Welcome to my art portfolio! Here I have all (or rather, most) of my art displayed on this page.</p>
                <p>
                    You can also find references and detailed descriptions of my characters, or to look at how I have progressed overtime.
                    Unfortunately, I do not draw as much as I used to, but there are some times where I'll make something out of nowhere when I am in the mood.
                </p>
                <p>I also have music on this site as well. I would consider it "art" after all. Once I produce more, it'll go into a separate category.</p>
            </div>
            <p><b>This page is still a work in progress!</b></p>
            <div>
                <h2><u>Sorted By Year</u></h2>
                <p>All of my art sorted in reverse-chronological order. You can see how much I have improved over the years!</p>
                
                <h2><u>Characters</u></h2>
                <h3><u>OCs</u></h3>
                <p>Art of my original characters. Click one to view their art and a description of them.</p>
                <h3><u>Other Characters</u></h3>
                <p>Characters that are not OCs (I guess you'd call this fanart?)</p>
                <h3><u>Misc.</u></h3>
                <p>Characters I have drawn maybe once or twice, and so they don't necessarily need their own page.</p>
