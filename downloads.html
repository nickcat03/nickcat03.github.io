                <p>A wiki for technical information on Kirby Super Star. Although it is called the "TAS" wiki, it has some interesting information even to those who aren't interested in the speedrunning scene. The page is in Japanese, so it will need to be translated into English. This page was organized by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/WaddleDX/">WaddleDX</a>.

                <p><a href="files/kss-practice-hack.zip">Download</a></p>
                <p>A Kirby Super Star practice hack for speedrunning. Can be played on flashcart. I have not completed all of MWW and planned to
                    add more but lost motivation to continue. This hack was made in PopStarCore. The file included is the patch file,
                    you will need to patch the ROM yourself with <a href="https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/">LunarIPS</a>.
                    Meant for the NTSC-J version of the game

                <p><a href="files/Goldens-KSS-Practice-v5.2.zip">Download</a></p>
                <p>Another KSS practice hack, but more refined with save states and a frame counter (aka a practice hack that was not just
                    slapped together in a level editor). This hack was developed by GoldenEpsilon.
                    Instructions on how to use the hack are in the readme. The file included is the patch file,
                    you will need to patch the ROM yourself with <a href="https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/">LunarIPS</a>.
                    Meant for the NTSC-U version of the game.

                <h3>PopStarCore English Translation</h3>
                <p><a href="files/PopstarcoreEnglish.exe">Download</a></p>
                <p>An English translation for the Kirby Super Star level editor, PopStarCore. Note that some menus are buggy, and due to
                    character limits, some translations may have shortened words. This project was started by Chuterix and Pancake001, which
                    was then worked on by myself. Note that the entire program is not complete but most of it is translated. You can find
                    documents for the program here: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080510142621/http://noimage.nobody.jp/index.html">Manual</a>,
                    and <a target="_blank" href="http://aquold.blog89.fc2.com/blog-entry-5.html">How-To Guide</a>,
                    but will need to be translated into English.

                <p>A level editor for Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land. I don't play KNiDL and never used this myself, but it's a Kirby level
                    editor so it is deemed worthy here.

                <p>This is a Kirby's Return to Dream Land level editor that does not have an English translation. I put it on this website
                    for archival purposes and to also make people aware that it exists. This program was originally translated from Chinese
                    into Japanese. The original website is <a href="https://w.atwiki.jp/kirby_return/pages/16.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
