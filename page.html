    Hey there code snooper :^) get outta my code!!!!!
    
    I'm just joking, you can look as much as you'd like. I hope you learn a thing or two from me.
    
    However, you might be in the wrong place. This site is a frame site, so right now you're looking at the frame structure, not the nitty gritty HTML stuff.
    
    To view that, you'll have to click on "This Frame" from the right-click menu. Then you'll see some options to view that particular section of the site.
    
    Hope this helps! And hey, if you're starting out fresh, feel free to tell me about your site!! I'd love to see it =)
