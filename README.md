# nickcat03.github.io
A silly personal website that was made for fun, and is meant to be a tribute to early website designs.

What is "Nippo"?  
Nippo is my online username. It sounds dumb I know.

Why does this site exist?  
Just for fun.

Why not make it more professional?  
Will make a professional site eventually (maybe).
