# nickcat03.github.io
A silly personal website that was made for fun, and is meant to be a tribute to early website designs.

What is "Nippo"?  
Nippo is my online username. It is meant to sound dumb, sorry if it weirds you out or something.

Why does this site exist?  
Because I can and it's fun to have one.

Why not make it more professional?  
Cuz that's boring. I'll make a better looking site eventually. Just enjoy the fun for now.
