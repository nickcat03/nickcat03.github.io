                <p>Hi there, I'm Nippo. Just another random person on the internet here. I think the best way to get an idea of my personality and interests is to browse my site. It pretty much oozes my personality. But, I wanted to create a page that kinda breaks it all down. Tl;dr, this page is to show you why you should care about my existence =)</p>
                <p>
                    I'm a big tech nerd, I think that's the best way I could explain myself in as few words as possible. I love to explore technology of the past, and how it has led to where we are today. Most of this technology is associated with video games, but I also enjoy studying the life-styles and habits of people during times where I haven't existed yet.

                    Times before mine feel like a strange realm. It is a time that I never was, and never will, be able to experience. I find it difficult to enjoy the present. Sometimes, thinking about the past reminds me that I should just live life how it is right now, just like how those in the past probably did. I enjoy archiving moments of my life, mostly through recording. I want to be able to look back at these videos to get a glimpse of a previous time. Kinda weird to think that our present will eventually be the past.

                    I pretty much live for video games, but the irony is that I spend more time collecting and repairing consoles rather than playing them. I play older games way more often than newer ones. The only music I listen to are video game OSTs or chiptune compositions. I enjoy composing chiptune music myself, but I haven't been doing it frequently.

                    One of my largest goals is to become an indie game developer, which is why I am a huge fan of coding, art, and music. I have many ideas on my mind for what I could make, but I just gotta do it. Hopefully you see my name out there someday.

                    I enjoy streaming games and playing them live. I used to speedrun a lot of games, notably ones from the Kirby series, but I am taking a break from it for now and have focused on casual games instead. If you'd like to see my speedrun repertoire you can click <a href="speedrunning.html">here</a>. I stream these speedruns on <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.twitch.tv/nippo4512">Twitch</a> if you'd like to check them out.

                    I sometimes draw art from time to time, but it's not very often (well, this background was designed by me a few years ago). All art of my character on this site (his name is Brulee) is drawn by me.

                    I have an interest in learning Japanese, however I typically don't have the time, patience, or motivation to continue learning. 勿体無い。

                    I think I've exhausted everything about myself, hope that's enough to keep you interested =)<br>
