                <p>Wow, so you're that interested and want to know a thing or two about me?</p>
                <p>
                    Well, before we discuss about me, I want to make sure you're doing alright.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to listen to the stories of others, and to learn something from them, we need to find ourselves first. What is 
                    your "About You"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've taken a moment to think about that, let yourself know that your story is important, and that you have the ability
                    to share that too. People care about your story, and people will listen to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, about me... I'm a 19 y/o Cybersecurity major who lives in New York City. I'm a big tech nerd, I think that's the best way
                    I could explain myself. I'm obsessed with computers and electronics, I cannot imagine a world without them. I sound kinda generic
                    though, don't I? I'm pretty sure any person in this day and age is not able to function without technology... which, when you think
                    about it, it's kind of scary. Yes, we have relied on man-made objects such as homes, streets, cars, planes, etc. But computers are
                    different, they are constantly changing and growing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compare a car now to a car from 50 years ago. What do they have in common? Well, for one, they both drive. You <i>can</i> use a car
                    from 50 years ago today. You'll miss the air conditioning though, I wouldn't recommend it. The point is, you can still use that car today,
                    and it functions as a car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now compare a computer from 50 years ago to computers we have now. Do you think you'd be able to use it today? I don't think so. It <i>is</i>
                    a computer, I'm not denying that. But the world changed so much that those past computers are now basically useless. We are still able to use 
                    older cars because our physical landscape has not changed enough for them to become obsolete, but our digital landscape is always changing,
                    and these computers are not fast enough to keep up with what we need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now you're probably asking yourself, "why is this weirdo getting all technical in his About Me page?" and that's because this is
                    what I think about. I'm always thinking about how technology has changed, how it has affected the world, how it was being used 10, 20,
                    30 years ago, as well as the inevitable (and scary) future. It's very fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to avoid the generic garbage that no one cares about. I want people to learn something from my own experiences, and I think that 
                    is the best "About Me" I could ask for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the generic garbage is important, and I'm not smart enough to make it sound all cool like I did with my little manifesto about
                    computers. So, if you still think I'm interesting, you can get to know more:

                    I sometimes draw art from time to time, but it's not very often. I still have yet to upload art on this site, I will get to that eventually
                    (well, this background was designed by me a few years ago).
                    All art of my character on this site (his name is Brulee) is drawn by me.

                    I have an interest in learning Japanese, however I typically don't have the time, patience, or motivation to continue learning. 勿体無い。

                    I think I've exhausted everything about myself, hope that's enough to keep you interested =)<br>
